    "## 1.1. Introduction\n",
    "Those interested in the world of machine learning are aware of the capabilities of reinforcement-learning-based AI. The past few years have seen many breakthroughs using reinforcement learning (RL). The company DeepMind combined deep learning with reinforcement learning to achieve above-human results on a multitude of Atari games and, in March 2016, defeated Go champion Le Sedol four games to one. Though RL is currently excelling in many game environments, it is a novel way to solve problems that require optimal decisions and efficiency, and will surely play a part in machine intelligence to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning, explained simply, is a computational approach where an agent interacts with an environment by taking actions in which it tries to maximize an accumulated reward. \n",
    "Here is a simple graph (the agent-environement loop), from the book [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction 2nd Edition](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html) :\n",
    "\n",
    "![RL](https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image3-5f8cbb1fb6fb9132fef76b13b8687bfc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent in a current state (St) takes an action (At) to which the environment reacts and responds, returning a new state(St+1) and reward (Rt+1) to the agent. Given the updated state and reward, the agent chooses the next action, and the loop repeats until an environment is solved or terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning provides the capacity for us not only to teach an artificial agent how to act, but to allow it to learn through it’s own interactions with an environment. By combining the complex representations that deep neural networks can learn with the goal-driven learning of an RL agent, computers have accomplished some amazing feats, like [beating humans at over a dozen Atari games](https://deepmind.com/dqn), and [defeating the Go world champion](https://deepmind.com/alpha-go).\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning how to build these agents requires a bit of a change in thinking for anyone used to working in a supervised learning setting though. Gone is the ability to simply get the algorithm to pair certain stimuli with certain responses. Instead RL algorithms must enable the agent to learn the correct pairings itself through the use of observations, rewards, and actions. Since there is no longer a “True” correct action for an agent to take in any given circumstance that we can just tell it, things get a little tricky. In this post and those to follow, I will be walking through the creation and training of reinforcement learning agents. The agent and task will begin simple, so that the concepts are clear, and then work up to more complex task and environments.\n"

    "\n",
    "The simplest reinforcement learning problem is the n-armed bandit. Essentially, there are n-many slot machines, each with a different fixed payout probability. The goal is to discover the machine with the best payout, and maximize the returned reward by always choosing it. We are going to make it even simpler, by only having two possible slot machines to choose between. In fact, this problem is so simple that it is more of a precursor to real RL problems than one itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, typical aspects of a task that make it an RL problem are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different actions yield different rewards. For example, when looking for treasure in a maze, going left may lead to the treasure, whereas going right may lead to a pit of snakes.\n",
    "- Rewards are delayed over time. This just means that even if going left in the above example is the right thing to do, we may not know it till later in the maze.\n",
    "- Reward for an action is conditional on the state of the environment. Continuing the maze example, going left may be ideal at a certain fork in the path, but not at others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The n-armed bandit is a nice starting place because we don’t have to worry about aspects #2 and 3. All we need to focus on is learning which rewards we get for each of the possible actions, and ensuring we chose the optimal ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of RL lingo, this is called learning a policy. We are going to be using a method called policy gradients, where our simple neural network learns a policy for picking actions by adjusting its weights through gradient descent using feedback from the environment. \n",
    "There is another approach to reinforcement learning where agents learn value functions. In those approaches, instead of learning the optimal action in a given state, the agent learns to predict how good a given state or action will be for the agent to be in. Both approaches allow agents to learn good behavior, but the policy gradient approach is a little more direct."

    "For this tutorial we are going to be attempting to solve the [FrozenLake](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0) environment from the OpenAI gym. For those unfamiliar, the [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) provides an easy way for people to experiment with their learning agents in an array of provided toy games. The FrozenLake environment consists of a 4x4 grid of blocks, each one either being the start block, the goal block, a safe frozen block, or a dangerous hole. The objective is to have an agent learn to navigate from the start to the goal without moving onto a hole. At any given time the agent can choose to move either up, down, left, or right. The catch is that there is a wind which occasionally blows the agent onto a space they didn’t choose. As such, perfect performance every time is impossible, but learning to avoid the holes and reach the goal are certainly still doable. The reward at every step is 0, except for entering the goal, which provides a reward of 1. Thus, we will need an algorithm that learns long-term expected rewards. This is exactly what Q-Learning is designed to provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "In it’s simplest implementation, Q-Learning is a table of values for every state (row) and action (column) possible in the environment. Within each cell of the table, we learn a value for how good it is to take a given action within a given state. In the case of the FrozenLake environment, we have 16 possible states (one for each block), and 4 possible actions (the four directions of movement), giving us a 16x4 table of Q-values. We start by initializing the table to be uniform (all zeros), and then as we observe the rewards we obtain for various actions, we update the table accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make updates to our Q-table using something called the [Bellman equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation), which states that the expected long-term reward for a given action is equal to the immediate reward from the current action combined with the expected reward from the best future action taken at the following state. In this way, we reuse our own Q-table when estimating how to update our table for future actions! In equation form, the rule looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "                Eq 1. Q(s,a) = r + γ(max(Q(s’,a’))\n",
    "                \n",
    "                \n",
    "This says that the Q-value for a given state (s) and action (a) should represent the current reward (r) plus the maximum discounted (γ) future reward expected according to our own table for the next state (s’) we would end up in. The discount variable allows us to decide how important the possible future rewards are compared to the present reward. By updating in this way, the table slowly begins to obtain accurate measures of the expected future reward for a given action in a given state. Below is a Python walkthrough of the Q-Table algorithm implemented in the FrozenLake environment:\n"

    "Now, you may be thinking: tables are great, but they don’t really scale, do they? While it is easy to have a 16x4 table for a simple grid world, the number of possible states in any modern game or real-world environment is nearly infinitely larger. For most interesting problems, tables simply don’t work. We instead need some way to take a description of our state, and produce Q-values for actions without a table: that is where neural networks come in. By acting as a function approximator, we can take any number of possible states that can be represented as a vector and learn to map them to Q-values.\n",

    "In the case of the FrozenLake example, we will be using a one-layer network which takes the state encoded in a one-hot vector (1x16), and produces a vector of 4 Q-values, one for each action. Such a simple network acts kind of like a glorified table, with the network weights serving as the old cells. The key difference is that we can easily expand the Tensorflow network with added layers, activation functions, and different input types, whereas all that is impossible with a regular table. The method of updating is a little different as well. Instead of directly updating our table, with a network we will be using backpropagation and a loss function. Our loss function will be sum-of-squares loss, where the difference between the current predicted Q-values, and the “target” value is computed and the gradients passed through the network. In this case, our Q-target for the chosen action is the equivalent to the Q-value computed in equation 1 above.\n",

Two tricks in particular are referred to as Experience Replay and Freezing Target Networks. Those improvements and other tweaks were the key to getting Atari-playing Deep Q-Networks, and we will be exploring those additions in the future. For more info on the theory behind Q-Learning, see this great post by Tambet Matiisen. I hope this tutorial has been helpful for those curious about how to implement simple Q-Learning algorithms!"

    "## 1.6. Policy Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to think of a Policy gradient network is one which produces explicit outputs. In the case of our bandit, we don’t need to condition these outputs on any state. As such, our network will consist of just a set of weights, with each corresponding to each of the possible arms to pull in the bandit, and will represent how good our agent thinks it is to pull each arm. If we initialize these weights to 1, then our agent will be somewhat optimistic about each arm’s potential reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "To update our network, we will simply try an arm with an e-greedy policy (See Part 7 for more on action-selection strategies). This means that most of the time our agent will choose the action that corresponds to the largest expected value, but occasionally, with e probability, it will choose randomly. In this way, the agent can try out each of the different arms to continue to learn more about them. Once our agent has taken an action, it then receives a reward of either 1 or -1. With this reward, we can then make an update to our network using the policy loss equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "                Loss = -log(π)*A\n",
    "\n",
    "A is advantage, and is an essential aspect of all reinforcement learning algorithms. Intuitively it corresponds to how much better an action was than some baseline. In future algorithms, we will develop more complex baselines to compare our rewards to, but for now we will assume that the baseline is 0, and it can be thought of as simply the reward we received for each action.\n",
    "\n",
    "π is the policy. In this case, it corresponds to the chosen action’s weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this loss function allows us to increase the weight for actions that yielded a positive reward, and decrease them for actions that yielded a negative reward. In this way the agent will be more or less likely to pick that action in the future. By taking actions, getting rewards, and updating our network in this circular manner, we will quickly converge to an agent that can solve our bandit problem! Don’t take my word for it though."

    "Environments which pose the full problem to an agent are referred to as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). These environments not only provide rewards and state transitions given actions, but those rewards are also condition on the state of the environment and the action the agent takes within that state. These dynamics are also temporal, and can be delayed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a little more formal, we can define a Markov Decision Process as follows. An MDP consists of a set of all possible states S from which our agent at any time will experience s. A set of all possible actions A from which our agent at any time will take action a. Given a state action pair (s, a), the transition probability to a new state s’ is defined by T(s, a), and the reward r is given by R(s, a). As such, at any time in an MDP, an agent is given a state s, takes action a, and receives new state s’ and reward r.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it may seem relatively simple, we can pose almost any task we could think of as an MDP. For example, imagine opening a door. The state is the vision of the door that we have, as well as the position of our body and door in the world. The actions are our every movement our body could make. The reward in this case is the door successfully opening. Certain actions, like walking toward the door are essential to solving the problem, but aren’t themselves reward-giving, since only actually opening the door will provide the reward. In this way, an agent needs to learn to assign value to actions the lead eventually to the reward, hence the introduction of temporal dynamics.\n"

    "### Cart-Pole Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this, we are going to need a challenge that is more difficult for the agent than the two-armed bandit. To meet provide this challenge we are going to utilize the OpenAI gym, a collection of reinforcement learning environments. We will be using one of the classic tasks, the Cart-Pole. To learn more about the OpenAI gym, and this specific task, check out their tutorial [here](https://gym.openai.com/docs). Essentially, we are going to have our agent learn how to balance a pole for as long as possible without it falling. Unlike the two-armed bandit, this task requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations — The agent needs to know where pole currently is, and the angle at which it is balancing. To accomplish this, our neural network will take an observation and use it when producing the probability of an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delayed reward — Keeping the pole in the air as long as possible means moving in ways that will be advantageous for both the present and the future. To accomplish this we will adjust the reward value for each observation-action pair using a function that weighs actions over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To take reward over time into account, the form of Policy Gradient we used in the previous tutorials will need a few adjustments. The first of which is that we now need to update our agent with more than one experience at a time. To accomplish this, we will collect experiences in a buffer, and then occasionally use them to update the agent all at once. These sequences of experience are sometimes referred to as rollouts, or experience traces. We can’t just apply these rollouts by themselves however, we will need to ensure that the rewards are properly adjusted by a discount factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively this allows each action to be a little bit responsible for not only the immediate reward, but all the rewards that followed. We now use this modified reward as an estimation of the advantage in our loss equation. With those changes, we are ready to solve CartPole!\n",
    "\n",
    "And with that we have a fully-functional reinforcement learning agent. Our agent is still far from the state of the art though. While we are using a neural network for the policy, the network still isn’t as deep or complex as the most advanced networks. In the next post I will be showing how to use Deep Neural Networks to create agents able to learn more complex relationships with the environment in order to play a more exciting game than pole balancing. In doing so, I will be diving into the kinds of representations that a network learns for more complex environments."

    "## 1.8. Model-Based RL\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will introduce the concept of a model of the environment that the agent can use to improve it’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a model and why would we want to use one? In this case, a model is going to be a neural network that attempts to learn the dynamics of the real environment. For example, in the CartPole we would like a model to be able to predict the next position of the Cart given the previous position and an action. By learning an accurate model, we can train our agent using the model rather than requiring to use the real environment every time. While this may seem less useful when the real environment is itself a simulation, like in our CartPole task, it can have huge advantages when attempting to learn policies for acting in the physical world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in computer simulations, physical environments take time to navigate, and the physical rules of the world prevent things like easy environment resets from being feasible. Instead, we can save time and energy by building a model of the environment. With such a model, an agent can ‘imagine’ what it might be like to move around the real environment, and we can train a policy on this imagined environment in addition to the real one. If we were given a good enough model of an environment, an agent could be trained entirely on that model, and even perform well when placed into a real environment for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "How are we going to accomplish this in Tensorflow? As I mentioned above, we are going to be using a neural network that will learn the transition dynamics between a previous observation and action, and the expected new observation, reward, and done state. Our training procedure will involve switching between training our model using the real environment, and training our agent’s policy using the model environment. By using this approach we will be able to learn a policy that allows our agent to solve the CartPole task without actually ever training the policy on the real environment! Read the iPython notebook below for the details on how this is done."

It will be built upon the simple one layer Q-network we created in Part 0, so I would recommend reading that first if you are new to reinforcement learning. While our ordinary Q-network was able to barely perform as well as the Q-Table in a simple game environment, Deep Q-Networks are much more capable. In order to transform an ordinary Q-Network into a DQN we will be making the following improvements:\n",

The pace of Deep Learning research is extremely fast, and the DQN of 2014 is no longer the most advanced agent around anymore. I will discuss two simple additional improvements to the DQN architecture, Double DQN and Dueling DQN, that allow for improved performance, stability, and faster training time. In the end we will have a network that can tackle a number of challenging Atari games, and we will demonstrate how to train the DQN to learn a basic navigation task."

    "Since our agent is going to be learning to play video games, it has to be able to make sense of the game’s screen output in a way that is at least similar to how humans or other intelligent animals are able to. Instead of considering each pixel independently, convolutional layers allow us to consider regions of an image, and maintain spatial relationships between the objects on the screen as we send information up to higher levels of the network. In this way, they act similarly to human receptive fields. Indeed there is a body of research showing that convolutional neural network learn representations that are [similar to those of the primate visual cortex](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003963). As such, they are ideal for the first few elements within our network.\n",

    "### Addition 2: Experience Replay\n",
    "The second major addition to make DQNs work is Experience Replay. The basic idea is that by storing an agent’s experiences, and then randomly drawing batches of them to train the network, we can more robustly learn to perform well in the task. By keeping the experiences we draw random, we prevent the network from only learning about what it is immediately doing in the environment, and allow it to learn from a more varied array of past experiences. Each of these experiences are stored as a tuple of <state,action,reward,next state>. The Experience Replay buffer stores a fixed number of recent memories, and as new ones come in, old ones are removed. When the time comes to train, we simply draw a uniform batch of random memories from the buffer, and train our network with them. For our DQN, we will build a simple class that handles storing and retrieving memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition 3: Separate Target Network\n",
    "The third major addition to the DQN that makes it unique is the utilization of a second network during the training procedure. This second network is used to generate the target-Q values that will be used to compute the loss for every action during training. Why not use just use one network for both estimations? The issue is that at every step of training, the Q-network’s values shift, and if we are using a constantly shifting set of values to adjust our network values, then the value estimations can easily spiral out of control. The network can become destabilized by falling into feedback loops between the target and estimated Q-values. In order to mitigate that risk, the target network’s weights are fixed, and only periodically or slowly updated to the primary Q-networks values. In this way training can proceed in a more stable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of updating the target network periodically and all at once, we will be updating it frequently, but slowly. This technique was introduced in another DeepMind paper earlier this year, where they found that it stabilized the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going Beyond DQN\n",
    "With the additions above, we have everything we need to replicate the DWN of 2014. But the world moves fast, and a number of improvements above and beyond the DQN architecture described by DeepMind, have allowed for even greater performance and stability. Before training your new DQN on your favorite ATARI game, I would suggest checking the newer additions out. I will provide a description and some code for two of them: Double DQN, and Dueling DQN. Both are simple to implement, and by combining both techniques, we can achieve better performance with faster training times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Double DQN\n",
    "The main intuition behind Double DQN is that the regular DQN often overestimates the Q-values of the potential actions to take in a given state. While this would be fine if all actions were always overestimates equally, there was reason to believe this wasn’t the case. You can easily imagine that if certain suboptimal actions regularly were given higher Q-values than optimal actions, the agent would have a hard time ever learning the ideal policy. In order to correct for this, the authors of DDQN paper propose a simple trick: instead of taking the max over Q-values when computing the target-Q value for our training step, we use our primary network to chose an action, and our target network to generate the target Q-value for that action. By decoupling the action choice from the target Q-value generation, we are able to substantially reduce the overestimation, and train faster and more reliably. Below is the new DDQN equation for updating the target value.\n",

    "        Q-Target = r + γQ(s’,argmax(Q(s’,a,ϴ),ϴ’))\n",

    "![Dueling DQN](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*N_t9I7MeejAoWlDuH1i7cw.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explain the reasoning behind the architecture changes that Dueling DQN makes, we need to first explain some a few additional reinforcement learning terms. The Q-values that we have been discussing so far correspond to how good it is to take a certain action given a certain state. This can be written as Q(s,a). This action given state can actually be decomposed into two more fundamental notions of value. The first is the value function V(s), which says simple how good it is to be in any given state. The second is the advantage function A(a), which tells how much better taking a certain action would be compared to the others. We can then think of Q as being the combination of V and A. More formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Q(s,a) =V(s) + A(a)\n",
    "        \n",
    "The goal of Dueling DQN is to have a network that separately computes the advantage and value functions, and combines them back into a single Q-function only at the final layer. It may seem somewhat pointless to do this at first glance. Why decompose a function that we will just put back together? The key to realizing the benefit is to appreciate that our reinforcement learning agent may not need to care about both value and advantage at any given time. For example: imagine sitting outside in a park watching the sunset. It is beautiful, and highly rewarding to be sitting there. No action needs to be taken, and it doesn’t really make sense to think of the value of sitting there as being conditioned on anything beyond the environmental state you are in. We can achieve more robust estimates of state value by decoupling it from the necessity of being attached to specific actions."

    "Now that we have learned all the tricks to get the most out of our DQN, let’s actually try it on a game environment! While the DQN we have described above could learn ATARI games with enough training, getting the network to perform well on those games takes at least a day of training on a powerful machine. For educational purposes, I have built a simple game environment which our DQN learns to master in a couple hours on a moderately powerful machine (I am using a GTX970). In the environment the agent controls a blue square, and the goal is to navigate to the green squares (reward +1) while avoiding the red squares (reward -1). At the start of each episode all squares are randomly placed within a 5x5 grid-world. The agent has 50 steps to achieve as large a reward as possible. Because they are randomly positioned, the agent needs to do more than simply learn a fixed path, as was the case in the FrozenLake environment from Tutorial 0. Instead the agent must learn a notion of spatial relationships between the blocks. And indeed, it is able to do just that!\n",

In A3C there is a global network, and multiple worker agents which each have their own set of network parameters. Each of these agents interacts with it’s own copy of the environment at the same time as the other agents are interacting with their environments. The reason this works better than having a single agent (beyond the speedup of getting more work done), is that the experience of each agent is independent of the experience of the others. In this way the overall experience available for training becomes more diverse."

The goal is to shoot the enemy as quickly as possible using as few bullets as possible. The agent has 300 time steps per episode to shoot the enemy. Shooting the enemy yields a reward of 1, and each time step as well as each shot yields a small penalty. After about 500 episodes per worker agent, the network learns a policy to quickly solve the challenge. Feel free to adjust parameters such as learning rate, clipping magnitude, update frequency, etc. to attempt to achieve ever greater performance or utilize A3C in your own RL tasks."
