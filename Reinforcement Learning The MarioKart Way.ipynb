    "## 1.1. Introduction\n",
    "Those interested in the world of machine learning are aware of the capabilities of reinforcement-learning-based AI. The past few years have seen many breakthroughs using reinforcement learning (RL). The company DeepMind combined deep learning with reinforcement learning to achieve above-human results on a multitude of Atari games and, in March 2016, defeated Go champion Le Sedol four games to one. Though RL is currently excelling in many game environments, it is a novel way to solve problems that require optimal decisions and efficiency, and will surely play a part in machine intelligence to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning, explained simply, is a computational approach where an agent interacts with an environment by taking actions in which it tries to maximize an accumulated reward. \n",
    "Here is a simple graph (the agent-environement loop), from the book [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction 2nd Edition](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html) :\n",
    "\n",
    "![RL](https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image3-5f8cbb1fb6fb9132fef76b13b8687bfc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent in a current state (St) takes an action (At) to which the environment reacts and responds, returning a new state(St+1) and reward (Rt+1) to the agent. Given the updated state and reward, the agent chooses the next action, and the loop repeats until an environment is solved or terminated.\n",

    "\n",
    "OpenAI was founded in late 2015 as a non-profit with a mission to “build safe artificial general intelligence (AGI) and ensure AGI's benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible.” In addition to exploring many issues regarding AGI, one major contribution that OpenAI made to the machine learning world was developing both the Gym and Universe software platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1. OpenAI Gym\n",
    "OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It makes no assumptions about the structure of your agent, and is compatible with any numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano. You can use it from Python code, and soon from other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI Gym consists of two parts:\n",
    "- The gym open-source library: a collection of test problems — environments — that you can use to work out your reinforcement learning algorithms. These environments have a shared interface, allowing you to write general algorithms.\n",
    "- The OpenAI Gym service: a site and API allowing people to meaningfully compare performance of their trained agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running our first agent\n",
    "Here's a bare minimum example of getting something running. This will run an instance of the CartPole-v0 environment for 1000 timesteps, rendering the environment at each step. You should see a window pop up rendering the classic cart-pole problem:"
